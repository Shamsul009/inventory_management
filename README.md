Project Name: Inventory Management System

Introduction : The owner of the company (admin), who may establish project details and maintain a dashboard to monitor the transfer from warehouse to store and store to others, is one of the three primary user categories in this system. The other two users are store employees who can deliver the item from the store to the seller and warehouse employees who can deliver the product from the warehouse to the store. Through the admin dashboard, the business owner is continuously aware of product updates.

Workflow:
    1.To interact with web page, JavaScript can handle events and make AJAX requests to the server.

    2.The PHP scripts on the server receive these requests, perform necessary operations (e.g., querying the database), and send back the results (usually in JSON format).

    3.JavaScript can then update the HTML dynamically based on the server's response, providing a seamless and interactive user experience.

    4.CSS is used to style the HTML elements, providing a visually appealing layout.
